## Exercise 7: Set up charge codes for Accounts receivable

### Create charge codes

1. Select **Accounts receivable &gt; Charges setup &gt; Charges code**.

2. Select **+New**. In the **Charges code** field, type a code for the charge.

3. In the **Description** field, type a description of the charge.

4. Optional: In the **Item sales tax group** field, select a sales tax group.

5. If you set the **Prorate** field to **Yes**, the calculated charges are prorated down to the sales line level. Because these charges are at the line level and not kept at the header level, a more specific link is made between the item and the charge value that calculated for it. This behavior can be useful in partial return scenarios, where an organization wants to refund only part of the charge instead of the whole charge when only some items are returned. 

6. On the **Posting** FastTab, specify how the charge is automatically debited and credited.

7. If you selected **Ledger account** as the debit type or credit type, specify a posting type in the **Debit posting** and **Credit posting** fields, and specify the main account in the **Debit account** and **Credit account** fields.

### Create charges groups for customers

1. Select **Accounts receivable &gt; Charges setup &gt; Customer charge groups**.

2. Select **+New**.

3. In the **Charges group** field, enter a code for the charges group. The code can contain both letters and numbers.

4. In the **Description** field, enter a description of the charges group.

5. Close the form to save your changes.

### Create item charges groups

1. Select **Accounts receivable &gt; Charges setup &gt; Item charge groups**.

2. Select **+New** to create an item charge group.

3. In the **Charges group** field, enter a code for the group. The code can be alphanumeric.

4. In the **Description** field, enter a description for the group.

5. Close the form to save your changes.
