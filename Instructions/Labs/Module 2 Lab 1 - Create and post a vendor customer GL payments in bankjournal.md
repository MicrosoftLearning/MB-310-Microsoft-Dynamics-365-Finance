# Lab - Create and post vendor, customer, general ledger payments

Heather, the bookkeeper at Contoso, must post a bank statement manually. Two customers paid an invoice, Heather needs to post payments to two vendors, and she also needs to post on main account 605160 for costs which are costs paid directly from the bank. If there are many bank transactions on a bank statement, these are normally imported. 


Due to the **segregation of duties,** Heather needs to post the vendor invoices from the module Accounts Payable, the customer invoices are posted from the Accounts receivable module, and costs paid directly from the bank should be posted in a general journal.

 

## Exercise 1:Determine open transaction Vendors

First, we need to find an open transaction for a vendor. 

1. Navigate to **Accounts payable** > **Inquiries and reports** > **Vendor reports** > **Vendor** **balance list** (This is a randomly chosen report, there are more reports that give a similar result).

2. Type **01/01/2016** in the field From date

3. Type **01/01/2016** in the field Report period start date

4. Type to date **12/31/2021.**

5. Select **OK**
	![](../images/Module_7_Activity_1_-_Create_and_post_a_bankjournal_image1.png)

	We will see the following open transactions (total amounts) for Vendor 1002 and 1002. (If your report comes out completely blank, then it may be a result of the **Feature management** setting for **Report PDF viewer**. Simply select Export from the Action menu and select PDF. Open file and you will see the results.) Heather will pay the two Vendors by bank. 


	Vendor 1001-48,674.19

	Vendor 1002-18,460.35

## Exercise 2:Determine open transaction Customers 
 
We will do the same for the customers.

1. Navigate to **Accounts Receivable** > **Inquiries and reports** > **Customers** > **Customer account statement (internal).** (This is a randomly chosen report, there are more reports that give a similar result).
 

2. Type **01/01/2016** in the from date field.


3. Type **12/31/2021** in the to date field.


4. Set the field Only open to **Yes** and select OK.
