## Exercise 3: Create an Audit Policy

Cassie, the internal auditor at Contoso determines that a new audit policy must be created for duplicate expense report lines in the USSI company. Duplicate expenses are defined as expenses within a 90-day window where the amount, the category, and the employee are identical.

You will create a policy rule type that will allow you to select the document that you want to audit and the query type you want to apply to that document. After you create the policy rule type, you will create an audit policy in which you will define the criteria for your query and the legal entities that the policy applies. You will then assign the policy to a batch and run it. 

As the policy runs, if any violations are found, audit cases will automatically be created and the document(s) that contain the violation will be attached to the audit cases.
