# Objective
You can define and assign risk assessments to customers based on their risk
score. A risk score is calculated by comparing customer information to each
scoring group. The scores are summed, and the total score is compared to the
values in the risk group setup to identify the risk group that the customer
belongs to. The risk group score is then used to define credit management
blocking and exclusion rules for the customer.

Risk scores can help determine the level of risk associated with a customer,
which provides you with the ability to hold orders and generate automatic credit
limits based on that risk. Risk scores are based on scoring groups that you
create.

Use the USMF company for the exercises in this lab.

## Exercise 1 Configure a scoring group 

During this lab, you will configure a scoring group, add the new group to a
customer, and calculate the risk group classification to determine how risky the
customer is.
