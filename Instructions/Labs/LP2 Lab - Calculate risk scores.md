# The Why

In today's dynamic business landscape, understanding and managing risk is paramount to the success and stability of any organization. This hands-on lab will empower you with the ability to calculate risk scores, a critical skill that enables you to identify, assess, and prioritize potential risks effectively. By mastering this process, you'll be equipped to contribute to your organization's risk management strategy, ensuring that potential threats are mitigated before they can impact operations. This lab is a practical tool that will enhance your decision-making capabilities and prepare you to handle real-world challenges with confidence and precision.


# Business scenario
Imagine you are a loan officer at a bank. Your job is to assess the creditworthiness of potential borrowers. To make an informed decision, you need to consider a variety of factors, such as the borrower's income, employment history, and credit score. A high credit score indicates a lower risk of the borrower defaulting on the loan, while a low credit score indicates a higher risk.

In this scenario, the risk score would be a numerical value that summarizes the overall creditworthiness of the borrower. The bank would have a set of criteria for calculating the risk score, and this score would be used to determine whether or not to approve the loan, and if so, what interest rate to charge.

By calculating risk scores, the bank can make more informed lending decisions. This can help to protect the bank from financial losses and ensure that loans are only made to borrowers who are likely to repay them.

customer is.
