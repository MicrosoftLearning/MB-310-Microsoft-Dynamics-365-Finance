### Create payment fees for customer payments

	- Select the type of journal that can use this payment fee. If these fees are used for customer payments, the journal type will likely be **Customer payment**.

	- Select **Save**.

2. Set up the payment fee:

	- Select **Payment fee setup**. The Payment fee setup is used to define the criteria for when the payment fee will be assessed. For example, you can define that the fee will be calculated if the bank account is **USMF OPER**, and the method of payment is **check**.

	- Select either **Table**, **Group** or **All** to define which bank accounts will be assessed this fee. If you select **All**, all bank accounts could be assessed this fee. If you select **Table**, only the bank account you select could be assessed this fee. If you select **Group**, only the bank accounts in the selected bank group could be assessed this fee.

	- Select either a **bank group** or a **bank account** for the **Bank relation**. If you selected **Table**, the lookup will display bank accounts. If you selected **Group**, the lookup will display **bank groups**.

	- Select the **Method of payment** for which this fee will be assessed. For example, you may assess a fee to your customers if they send payments as a check, rather than as an electronic payment.

	- Enter a **payment currency**. The payment currency is used as an additional criterion for whether the fee will be assessed. For example, your bank may charge an extra fee for payments received in **USD** currency, since they normally only transact in **EUR** currency.

	- Select whether the fee will be a **percent**, **amount** or **interval**. Enter either **percentage** or **amount** of the fee. If the **Percentage/Amount** field is **Percent**, then the value enter here will be a percentage. If the **Percentage/Amount** field is **Amount**, then the value you enter here will be an amount. If the **Percentage/Amount** field is **Interval**, use the **Interval** tab to define the tiers.

	- In the **Fee currency** field, select the currency of the fee. This is the currency in which the fee will be created.
