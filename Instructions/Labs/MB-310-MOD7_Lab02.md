5. If you select **Specify number of periods**, enter the number of accounting periods for the budget cycle.

6. If you select **Map to fiscal year**, the budget cycle time span uses the fiscal year that is defined by the starting and ending periods for the budget cycle.

7. Select **+Add**. Enter the name of the first period in the budget cycle time span and enter the date when that period starts. The ending date for the budget cycle is determined automatically based on the number of fiscal periods in the budget cycle time span.
