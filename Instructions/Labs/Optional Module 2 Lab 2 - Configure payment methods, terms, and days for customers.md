# Lab: Configure payment methods, terms, and days for customers

## Objective

Payment terms determine how you manage due dates. The same payment terms are available for sales and purchase documents. When you post an invoice, the due date is calculated based on the payment terms. Each payment type that a company accepts must be configured when the system is set up. 

You can use payment days to define the payment day used for calculating the due date. Payment day can be specified for either a day in the week or in the month. This helps payment proposal to suggest those customer invoices that should be brought into the customer payment journal for posting. 

In this this lab you will set up a payment method for customers. You will then set up terms of payment. Finally, you will set up a payment day.
