# The Why
Understanding how to perform bank foreign currency revaluation is crucial for anyone working in finance or accounting within a global business environment. This hands-on lab will equip you with the practical skills needed to manage and revalue foreign currency transactions accurately, ensuring financial statements reflect true economic conditions. By mastering these techniques, you'll be able to mitigate risks associated with currency fluctuations, enhance financial reporting accuracy, and contribute to more informed decision-making within your organization. This lab is not just an academic exercise; it's a vital competency that will empower you to handle real-world financial challenges with confidence and precision.


# Business scenario

Imagine you are an accountant for a company that conducts international business. The company maintains bank accounts in various currencies to facilitate these transactions. Due to fluctuations in exchange rates, the value of the foreign currency holdings can change over time relative to the company's home currency. This can cause discrepancies between the book value (recorded value in the company's financial statements) and the fair value (market value) of the foreign currency holdings.

To address this issue, companies must periodically revalue their foreign currency bank accounts. This hands-on exercise will guide you through the process of revaluing bank foreign currency in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance.

By following the steps in this exercise, you will learn how to:

- Set up the accounting and reporting currencies for bank accounts.
- Update currency exchange rates.
- Execute the foreign currency revaluation process.

This process will ensure that the company's financial statements accurately reflect the current value of its foreign currency holdings.


Use the **USMF** company for the exercises in this lab.

## Exercise 1 Create a transaction that can be revalued 

During this lab, you will first enter a transaction in a bank journal that can
be revalued. The second step is to prepare foreign currency revaluation. After
you configure the foreign currency revaluation, you run the process and then
review the results.

**Scenario**

Contoso, Ltd. has a new financial controller who plans to run a foreign currency
revaluation of bank account USMF EUR as part of the period end. To test the
process, the financial controller first creates a general journal with a
transaction that can be revalued.
