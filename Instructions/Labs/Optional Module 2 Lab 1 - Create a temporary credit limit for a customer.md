# Lab Create a temporary credit limit for a customer

## Objective

Temporary credit limits override customer credit limits for a defined period. You can add temporary credit limits by using credit limit adjustments. These adjustments let credit managers update the credit limits and end dates of a single customer, a group of customers, or all customers through a posting process. 

### Scenario 

You need to set up a temporary credit limit for customer **US-003** in legal entity **USMF**. The current credit limit for the customer is $400,000, until the end of next month, the limit is $500,000. 

1.  Open your **Dynamics 365 Finance** environment and using the **Company picker**, change the legal entity to **USMF**.
