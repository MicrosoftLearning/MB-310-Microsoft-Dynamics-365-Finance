# Lab Configure tax ledger posting groups

You have a new customer in Arizona. You need to create the customer in the system. You must set up a ledger account to ensure that tax is posted to main account named Arizona State Tax Payable. You must also set up a new sales tax code and use the new sales tax code in a free text invoice. 

Sales tax is calculated and posted to main accounts that are specified in Ledger posting groups. Ledger posting groups are attached to each sales tax code. You can set up individual ledger posting groups for each sales tax code, use one ledger posting group for all sales tax codes or assign multiple ledger posting groups to the sales tax codes.
