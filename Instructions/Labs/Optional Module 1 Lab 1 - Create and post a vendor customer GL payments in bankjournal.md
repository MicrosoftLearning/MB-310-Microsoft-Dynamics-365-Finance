# Lab: Create and post vendor, customer, general ledger payments

## Objective

Heather, the bookkeeper at Contoso, must post a bank statement manually. Two customers paid an invoice, Heather needs to post payments to two vendors, and she also needs to post on main account 605160 for costs which are costs paid directly from the bank. If there are many bank transactions on a bank statement, these are normally imported. 

Due to the **segregation of duties**, Heather needs to post the vendor invoices from the **Accounts payable** module, the customer invoices are posted from the **Accounts receivable** module, and costs paid directly from the bank should be posted in a general journal.

1.  Open your **Dynamics 365 Finance** environment and using the **Company picker**, change the legal entity to **USMF**. 


## Exercise 1: Determine open transaction Vendors

First, we need to find an open transaction for a vendor. 

1.  In the **Accounts payable** module, navigate to **Inquiries and reports** > **Vendor reports** > **Vendor balance list**.

    **Note:** This is just one report to check, there are other inquiries and reports that will give similar results. 

2.  In the **Vendor balance list** pane, enter `1/1/2016` in the field **From date**. 

3.  Enter `1/1/2016` in the field **Report period start date**. 

4.  Enter **To date** as `12/31/2021`. 

5.  Select **OK**. 

    ![](../images/Module_7_Activity_1_-_Create_and_post_a_bankjournal_image1.png)

    We will see the following open transactions (total amounts) for Vendor accounts **1001** and **1002**. 

    **Note:** If the report comes out completely blank, then the **Feature management** setting for **Report PDF viewer** may be set incorrectly. Select the **Export** menu from the action pane and select **PDF**. Open the file and you will see the results.
    
    Heather will pay the two Vendors by bank transfer. 

    | Vendor account | Name                     | Total         |
    |----------------|--------------------------|---------------|
    | 1001           | Acme Office Supplies     | -48,674.19    |
    | 1002           | Lande Packaging Supplies | -18,460.35    |

## Exercise 2: Determine open transaction Customers 
 
We will do the same for the customers. 

1.  In the **Accounts Receivable** module, navigate to **Inquiries and reports** > **Customers** > **Customer account statement (internal)**.  

    **Note:** This is just one report to check, there are other inquiries and reports that will give similar results. 
 
2.  Enter `1/1/2016` in the **From date** field. 

3.  Enter `12/31/2021` in the **To date** field. 

4. Set the **Only open** field to **Yes** and select **OK**.
