# Lab Create a temporary credit limit for a customer

Temporary credit limits override customer credit limits for a defined period. You can add temporary credit limits by using credit limit adjustments. These adjustments let credit managers update the credit limits and end dates of a single customer, a group of customers, or all customers through a posting process.
